# APIFramework
This Framework was developed to allow developers to move there existing code to SOA or Microservice framework easily.  
APIFramework to expose API/microservices out of your current code. 
This framework has OAUTH2 authentication tied with Facebook and Google OAUTH2 implementation. 


Implementation includes
1. REST Service needs to be exposed  (Spring REST or JAX RS) [support for API versioning]
2. OAUTH2 Server implementation with Facebook and google authentication option (Spring Security
3. Hibernate implementation for ORM
4. Configurations in annotations 
5. Event Driven Integration using Rabbit-MQ
6. Maven project


This is just a project and is developed by me the next step will be to move it as a adaptation where this will have a  better way of adaptation.
